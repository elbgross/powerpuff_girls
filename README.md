ðŸŒƒ BREATHE NEY YORKðŸ—½
Goal: Our main objective was to identify the most polluted areas in Greater New York by analysing 4 different datasets:
      1. Dataset from OpenAQ -> real-time data on fluctuating levels of multiple air pollutants and toxins detected by a network of sensors located throughout the city
      2. Green areas and trees distribution
      3. Noise complains
      4. Traffic Volume
Business Idea: Assess whether homes are reasonably priced based on air quality and public health conditions, and identify overlooked investment opportunities across different boroughs
Process:

ðŸŒŽ Extract real-time data from OpenAQ through their API
      1. The first step was indetifying the pollutants and toxins to take into consideration, based on data availability and time range
      2. Checked availability of data per sensor location within the range 2016 and 2025, to ensure we had recent data detected for most locations
      3. Extracted one pollutant ( = parameter on OpenAQ) at a time and selected PM2.5, PM10, PM1 being the most consistent data, detected by several sensors in every borough

ðŸŒ³ Merge all datasets by borough and draw any conclusions by analysing data correlations:
      1. Calculated the average annual pollutant concentration for each borough, along with the number of trees, traffic volume, and noise complaint counts
      2. Created a health score for each borough by combining relevant metrics from all datasets

Insights and potential initiatives:
Observation: Investing in sustainability initiatives in the Bronx seems worthwhile based on this study, and could help reverse the boroughâ€™s current economic situation
Practical Applications:
