## Goal: 
Our main objective was to identify the most polluted areas in Greater New York by analyzing four different datasets:

1. **OpenAQ dataset**: real-time data on fluctuating levels of multiple air pollutants and toxins detected by a network of sensors located throughout the city  
2. **Green areas and tree distribution**  
3. **Noise complaints**  
4. **Traffic volume**


## Business Idea:  
Business Idea: Assess whether homes are reasonably priced based on air quality and public health conditions, and identify overlooked investment opportunities across different boroughs.

## Process:

### ðŸŒŽ Extract real-time data from OpenAQ through their API
1. Identified pollutants and toxins to consider, based on data availability and time range.  
2. Checked the availability of data per sensor location between 2016 and 2025, ensuring recent readings across most locations.  
3. Extracted one pollutant (parameter) at a time, focusing on PM2.5, PM10, and PM1, which showed the most consistent data across boroughs.

### ðŸŒ³ Merge all datasets by borough and analyze correlations
1. Calculated the average annual pollutant concentration for each borough, along with the number of trees, traffic volume, and noise complaint counts.  
2. Created a health score for each borough by combining metrics from all datasets.


## ðŸ’¡ Insights and Potential Initiatives  

- **Observation:** Investing in sustainability initiatives in the Bronx appears promising, as it could help reverse the boroughâ€™s current economic situation.  
- **Practical Applications:**  
  - Study historical price trends and environmental evolution, and build a predictive model that estimates future property prices considering environmental factors
  - Analyze the correlations between social dynamics and environmental conditions, creating a zoom-in map with a health score specific to neighbourhoods
